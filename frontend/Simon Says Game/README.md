## Description

The Simon Says Game is a digital adaptation of the classic memory game. Players must remember and repeat a sequence of colors or sounds, testing their memory and reflexes. It's a fun and engaging way to challenge your cognitive skills and improve memory retention.

## Rules

1. The game consists of four colored buttons: red, blue, green, and yellow.
2. Simon, the electronic device, produces a series of tones and lights at random.
3. The player must repeat the sequence by pressing the colored buttons in the same order.
4. If the player succeeds in repeating the sequence correctly, Simon adds one more tone to the previous sequence.
5. The game continues indefinitely, with Simon adding one more tone to the sequence each time.
6. If the player makes a mistake, the game ends, and the player's score is displayed.
